What Is A DDos-Attack
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable
by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. They target a wide variety of important resources from banks to news websites, and present a major challenge to making sure people can publish and access important information

This will identify the open ports and its will ask on which port do you want to do the Dos attack .
